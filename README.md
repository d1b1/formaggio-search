## Bare-Bones Backbone.js App using Formagg.io!

This is a simple Backbone.js app. It uses standard
view and HTML script urls and templates. No layout manager
and no abstractions. This is built to show the
individual parts of backbone app. There are lots of other
BB example that add in layers of abstractions. I wrote this
to remind myself of how to build fast and lightway backbone.js
app without the need to think about all the features and benefits
that come with require.js, AMD, gulp or grunt.

### Live Demo

### Learn more about the formagg.io API
<http://api.formagg.io/> - Formagg.io is a cheese API, with
a mission to map the artisan cheeses of the world.

### Coming SOON!
The following features are my wish list.

* Local Storage Plugin for Backbone Collections.
* Infinite scroll.
* Collection Paging.
* List vs Panel view.
