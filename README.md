## Bare-bones Backbone.js App using Formagg.io!

This is a simple Backbone.js app. It uses standard
view and HTML script urls and templates. No layout manager
and no abstractions. This is built to show the
individual parts of backbone app. There are lots of other
BB example that add in layers of abstractions. I wrote this
to remind myself of how to build fast and quickly and keep
the code super easy to read.
